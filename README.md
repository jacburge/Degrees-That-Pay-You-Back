# Degrees That Pay You Back: A Clustering Analysis

## Introduction
Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set with an Engineering degree? Choosing a college major tends to be a complex decision evaluating personal interest, difficulty, and career potential. If you're curious about the potential short and long term financial implications of this _major_ decision, join me in applying a clustering analysis to explore salary increase by college degree.

This project is based on the PayScale's Degrees That Pay You Back data referenced in the Wall Street Journal article Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay: https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121746658635199271. Similar further analysis could be done on the additional datasets available, examining salary potential based on the type and region of college attended.
